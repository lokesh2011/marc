      <h1><u>Hi,I'm Marc</u></h1>
      <p>…and I work for the next generation of makers.</p>
      <p>
        Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is
        ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that
        inspires them. However,<b
          >today’s world isn’t designed to work for these makers
        </b>
        creating an imbalance between the impact they’re capable of, and what’s
        expected of them.
      </p>
      <p>I’m working to solve this problem…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          by creating better tools at Sdui for education and formerly at
          Hackerbay for hackers and companies;
        </li>
        <li>
          by building communities, formerly as co-founder of Hackevents
          organizing hackathons across Germany, now by mentoring at hackathons
          around the world;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>…and through one commit at a time.</p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am working as Head of Engineering at Sdui. It’s an amazing
        gig where I get to work alongside great developers on a software product
        that has become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of
        teachers, parents and students rely to guarantee essential
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently living in Helsinki, Finland. Some other places I’ve lived
        in are Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Munich.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the
        accelerating expansion of the universe, or better know as Dark Energy
        here.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Previously</u></h2>
      <p>
        I founded and built Hackerbay as CTO with three awesome friends. We took
        a small insight from hackathons – software is not a 12 month development
        cycle – and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone,
        Allianz and some of Germany’s largest corporations. With NFX we had
        incredible investors on board and always an open ear from James, Pete,
        or Gigi.
      </p>
      <p>
        After five years of immense personal and professional growth, priorities
        changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities, where each of our
        personal strengths are best put to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me that’s building tools for enabling the next billion developers.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Let’s connect</u></h2>
      <p>
        I’m most active on Twitter and GitHub but you can also find me on
        LinkedIn. The best way to contact me is either through Twitter, or my
        email at my first name @ mfts.io – my DMs and inbox are always open.
